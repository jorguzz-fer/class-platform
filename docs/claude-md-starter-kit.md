# The CLAUDE.md Starter Kit

Get better output from Claude Code in 5 minutes. No plugins, no MCP servers, no
configuration — just markdown files in the right places.

## The 3-Level Hierarchy

Claude Code reads instructions from three locations. Each has a different scope:

```
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md          -> Global: your personal preferences (every project)
.claude/CLAUDE.md            -> Project: shared with your team (committed to git)
./CLAUDE.local.md            -> Local: your personal overrides (gitignored)
```

- **Global** = rules you'd repeat across every project ("always run tests," "prefer simple code").
- **Project** = context your whole team benefits from (stack, structure, commands, conventions).
- **Local** = stuff only you need (your terminal, your MCP servers, your editor quirks).

## Quick Start

### 1. Create your global file (~2 min)

```
mkdir -p ~/.claude
cp global/CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

Edit it with your personal preferences. Keep it under 15 lines.

### 2. Create your project file (~3 min)

```
mkdir -p .claude
# Pick the template closest to your stack:
cp project/nextjs-typescript.md .claude/CLAUDE.md   # Next.js / React / TypeScript
cp project/python-fastapi.md .claude/CLAUDE.md      # Python / FastAPI
cp project/generic.md .claude/CLAUDE.md             # Anything else
```

Fill in the blanks. Commit it to git so your team gets the same behavior.

### 3. Create your local overrides (~1 min)

```
cp local/local.md ./CLAUDE.local.md
echo "CLAUDE.local.md" >> .gitignore
```

Add your personal setup. This file lives at the project root (not inside
`.claude/`) and is never shared.

### 4. Add rules for your codebase (~2 min, optional)

```
mkdir -p .claude/rules
cp rules/code-style.md .claude/rules/code-style.md
cp rules/testing.md .claude/rules/testing.md
# Edit placeholders like [your test command]
```

Rules are modular instruction files. Path-scoped rules only load when Claude
works with matching files. See `principles.md` for when and why to use rules vs
CLAUDE.md.

Your final setup should look like this:

```
your-project/
├── .claude/
│   ├── CLAUDE.md              # Project instructions (committed)
│   └── rules/
│       ├── code-style.md      # Always loaded
│       └── testing.md         # Loaded when working with test files
├── CLAUDE.local.md            # Your personal overrides (gitignored)
└── ...
```

## How It Works

Claude Code automatically reads these files at the start of every session. All
discovered files are concatenated into context — they don't override each other.
When instructions conflict, Claude sees the last one it read. Within each
directory, `CLAUDE.local.md` loads after `CLAUDE.md`, so your personal notes get
the final word at that level.

**Important:** Claude Code's system prompt already contains ~50 instructions.
That's a third of the ~150-200 instruction limit frontier models can reliably
follow. Your CLAUDE.md must be lean. Every line competes for attention.

**Auto memory:** Claude also maintains its own notes at
`~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/` — build commands it discovers, patterns
from your corrections, debugging insights. These load at session start too. You
don't need to put things in CLAUDE.md that Claude will learn on its own. Run
`/memory` to see everything that's loaded. See `principles.md` for when to use
CLAUDE.md vs auto memory.

## The Self-Improvement Loop

This is the single most impactful habit you can build:

> After every correction you give Claude, end with:
> "Update CLAUDE.md so you don't make that mistake again."

Claude is good at writing rules for itself. Over time, your CLAUDE.md becomes a
living document that gets smarter with every session.

## What Goes Where (Decision Guide)

| Rule                              | Where it goes | Why                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| "Run tests after changes"         | Global        | You want this everywhere |
| "Use shadcn/ui components"        | Project       | Team convention      |
| "I use Ghostty terminal"          | Local         | Only you need this   |
| "Never use `any` in TypeScript"   | Project       | Team standard        |
| "Ask before committing"           | Global        | Personal preference  |
| "I have Context7 MCP configured"  | Local         | Your setup, not theirs |
| "Prices are in src/lib/config"    | Project       | Domain knowledge     |
| "Keep code simple"                | Global        | Universal preference |

## Common Mistakes

- **Too long.** If your project CLAUDE.md is over 80 lines, Claude starts
  ignoring parts of it. HumanLayer keeps theirs under 60 lines. That's a good
  benchmark.
- **Personality instructions.** "Be a senior engineer" or "Think step by step"
  wastes tokens. Claude Code already has strong system-level instructions.
- **@-mentioning docs.** Writing `@docs/api-guide.md` embeds the entire file into
  context every single session. Instead, pitch Claude on when to read it: "For
  Stripe integration issues, see docs/stripe-guide.md."
- **Formatting rules without a formatter.** If you have a linter/formatter
  configured, use a hook to run it — don't burn CLAUDE.md lines on what a tool
  enforces. But if you don't have a formatter, concrete style rules like "Use
  2-space indentation" are exactly the kind of specific instruction Anthropic
  recommends.
- **Duplicate rules.** If your global file says "run tests" and your project file
  also says "run tests," you've wasted tokens saying the same thing twice.

## Scaling Up: Module-Specific Files

For larger codebases, you can place CLAUDE.md files in subdirectories:

```
.claude/CLAUDE.md              -> Project root (always loaded)
src/auth/CLAUDE.md             -> Auth module (loaded when working in src/auth/)
src/api/CLAUDE.md              -> API module (loaded when working in src/api/)
```

Claude Code loads these on demand — only when working in that directory. This
keeps your root file lean while giving Claude deep context where it matters.

Use this when your root CLAUDE.md pushes past 80 lines, or when different parts
of the codebase have different conventions.

## Scaling Up: Rules

For rules that only apply to specific parts of your codebase, use
`.claude/rules/`:

```
.claude/rules/
  testing.md          -> Only activates for test files
  api-design.md       -> Only activates for API route handlers
  code-style.md       -> No path restriction = applies everywhere
```

Rules use YAML frontmatter with `paths` globs to scope when they activate. See
`rules/` in this repo for annotated guides you can adapt to your stack, and
`principles.md` for the full guide on writing effective rules.

**CLAUDE.md vs rules:** Use CLAUDE.md for project-wide context (stack, commands,
structure). Use rules for focused standards that apply to specific file types or
directories.

## Security (Hardening Defaults)

> **Reality check:** No CLAUDE.md makes code literally "hacker-proof." What it
> does well is encode strong, universal secure-coding defaults that Claude follows
> in every project. Treat these as baselines, not a substitute for security
> reviews, automated scanning, and pentesting.

Put these in your **global** CLAUDE.md (they apply everywhere). For deeper,
stack-specific standards, create a path-scoped `.claude/rules/security.md`.

- **Never commit secrets** (keys, tokens, passwords). Use environment variables /
  a secret manager, and check the diff before committing.
- **Treat all external input as untrusted**: validate and sanitize it (prevents
  injection, XSS, path traversal). Validate on the server, never trust the client.
- **Data access**: use parameterized queries / an ORM — never concatenate SQL or
  shell commands with user input.
- **Never log or expose sensitive data** (passwords, tokens, PII) in logs, error
  messages, or API responses.
- Apply the **principle of least privilege** to credentials, tokens, file
  permissions, and CORS.
- **Don't disable protections to "fix" an error** (TLS, certificate verification,
  CSP, auth checks). Fix the root cause instead.
- Use **battle-tested libraries** for auth, crypto, and sessions — never roll your
  own crypto.
- **Keep dependencies updated**; when touching dependencies, run an audit
  (`npm audit`, `pip-audit`) where it makes sense.
- **Fail securely**: deny by default, and don't leak stack traces or internal
  details to end users.
- When you find a security flaw, **flag it explicitly** instead of silently
  working around it.

Layer these advisory rules with **deterministic enforcement** — secret-scanning
hooks (e.g. gitleaks), dependency audits in CI, SAST, and a pre-commit hook — so
security doesn't rely on attention budget alone.

## The Principles (Go Deeper)

`principles.md` contains everything we know about writing effective CLAUDE.md
files:

- The attention budget (why less is more)
- Advisory vs deterministic: CLAUDE.md vs hooks
- Anthropic's official include/exclude table
- `.claude/rules/` — path-scoped modular rules with YAML frontmatter
- Writing rules Claude actually follows (with bad/good examples)
- Emphasis keywords that actually work (IMPORTANT, YOU MUST)
- Module-specific CLAUDE.md files for scaling
- Progressive disclosure patterns and `@import` syntax
- Architecture diagrams (HumanLayer's pattern)
- The "Don't X, Do Y" rule
- Troubleshooting: "Claude isn't following my rules" diagnostic checklist
- Matt Pocock's plan loop
- Real-world benchmarks from HumanLayer, Boris Cherny, Cloudflare, ChrisWiles
- Skill activation mapping
- TODO priority systems
- Every anti-pattern and what to do instead

If you only read one file in this kit besides the templates, read that one.
